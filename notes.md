so take a look at tmdb and propose how I can improve content discovery and filtering etc. we have 3 main sections which is great (movies, tv and animation) the search works perfectly, but I would really like to have a muc richer experience for content discovery, lets for now keep the 3 main categories and propose to me how you would suggest we can add functionality, I'm thinking within each section to at least allow filtering by provider (e.g prime video, netflix, HBO etc) as that exists within the API and it would be a good little addition to allow selection of content from each provider - lets stick to say the top 10 providers (with other category too so we can ensure the best of the rest is not missed!). then lets look at another alternative, lets say by type of content (comedy. scifi etc).
Remember I want to keep the 3 divisions of the site for now (tv, movies and 16+/animation), but under the divisons I want you to suggest and implement based on my above thinking. It must be intuitive and useful. Ensure you keep with the aethetics that already exist, DO NOT at this stage worry about content filtering or age etc. at the moment this is a content discovery slice, we can add the restrictions and reporting later.
